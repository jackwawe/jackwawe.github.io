   <p class="text-color", class="text-indent"> My project was creating a visualization to back up my critique. For my critique I reviewed the 
    <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/animated-treemap">Animated tree map</a>. I suggested a lot of changes, all of which I wanted to include in my final 
    project and display the tree map in an alternative way that was more communicative.
    My idea was that a linear scale communicates quantitative information better. 
    So, my idea was to use the same data as the original critique and show horizontal bars instead.
    Also, I found that using geographic region to separate the different populations was not communicating well
    and made comparisons hard. So, I planned to remove the different geographic regions and use only one color 
    for the different states. I would then add an option to show state by region, where the user would be able
    to choose different religions and only states in that region would show. The design process was hence easy, 
    and the final verdict was a dynamic horizontal bar chart where positions changed dynamically in descending order.
    As far as my visualization design choices are concerned, I have laid them out well in my critique, this is one of 
    the reasons I chose to create a visualization base on my critique, because I need not repeat why I chose different
    channel for my final project. Please refer to my critique for details on my choices used in the final project.
    The coding was the hardest part. D3.js dot notion is quite unintuitive. I have programmed with python, java and R,
    but I found it hard to connect ideas with D3. However, I used the text recommended for class and watched class and
    YouTube videos and was able to get the code running, although it took a significant amount of effort and time. 
    I first cleaned the data, removed blanks, and converted it to an excel csv file for easy access. Making the static
    bar graph was not very demanding but getting them to grow in size and change position took a lot of try and error.
    Even after I was able to make them change positions, the totals at the end of the bars had a delayed transition, 
    so the bars were moving first then the totals, instead of both  moving in sync. My attempt to sync them was futile,
    given my inexperience with D3 and time constraints. Overall, I was able to have it work, but not to my full expectations. 
    I would have loved to add a drop down list where a user would choose a particular state, which would then be highlighted
    with a color to make a popout effect (My choice would have been red). I would also have loved to give the user the choice
    to see states by region, so that southern state where highlighted red while northern states were highlighted blue, 
    for example. Otherwise, I was proud of the final product
